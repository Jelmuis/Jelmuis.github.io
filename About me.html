            For me, the Korg Minilogue opened up a whole new world of music. In the past, being a guitar and bassguitar player, I was always looking for the correct melody in a very basic way. On the one hand I could and still do enjoy the roar of distortion and octave effects, but on the other hand my curiosity led me to the other type of music which I like the most.  Being a fan of ambient I was always missing that one instrument where I could make these long stretches of tones whilst dreaming away during jam sessions.
            Listening a lot to bands/artists like Sigur Rós, Bon Iver, Radiohead and Hammock I found out that this was the type of music that I loved, and I enjoyed playing the most. Those moments when me and my band were playing those slow ambient jams where the most enjoyable moments for me during those nights.

            When using this single type of instrument, I close my eyes, put a sequencer on loop and see where the nobs and levers take me. In which corner of the ambient realm I end up depends on various factors, and is different every evening. Sometimes I save the sequence to work on the days after, other times I delete it, knowing that the music is gone forever. This is what I enjoy the most of this instrument. With a guitar the sound is “fixed”, with the Minilogue you can make almost any sound you’d like. The possibilities are endless, your limitation is your own imagination.
