            <p><h1>Amp eg and LFO</h1>
            The Amp eg or Envelope Generator of the Minilogue’s options are a bit basic—two ADSRs, (Attack,Decay, Sustain and Release) one dedicated to amp and the other for all other envelope modulation duties—the second envelope offers two routings that you don’t often see on mainstream synths. 
            It can modulate either the rate or the intensity of the LFO modulation.
            If you modulate the LFO intensity with the envelope, you can re-create the old-school polysynth effect of “delayed vibrato.” 
            That is, by setting the envelope sustain to maximum and decay to zero, you can fade in vibrato as you hold a note by giving the envelope a long attack. 
            As for LFO-rate (Low Frequenty Oscillator) modulation, it’s more of a sound effect when applied to pitch, but sounds lovely applied to the oscillator shape parameter in a subtle manner.
            
            <h1>LFO</h1>
            Speaking of the LFO, it can only be routed to three destinations—pitch, cutoff and waveshape. 
            Confusing things slightly is the minilogue’s unorthodox implementation of the sawtooth wave, specifically when used to modulate the oscillator’s saw-tooth waveshape. 
            Here, if the oscillator sawtooth shape parameter is set to zero and sawtooth modulation is applied to the waveshape, it will sound like a triangle wave. 
            This is because the LFO sawtooth wave folds back on itself in instances like this.So, if you apply that type of modulation to the sawtooth waveshape of an oscillator, the results will be slightly unpredictable. Interestingly, this effect doesn’t occur on the triangle or square waves, which function reliably in repeating fashion.
