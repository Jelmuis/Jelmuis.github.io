           <p><h1>The Filter</h1> The Filter section consists of three knobs and three levers. The first and most used knob is the "Filter" knob. This function allows the user to filter the sound,
            letting only the low or high sounds through to the speakers. Furthermore we have the "Resonance" knob, allowing the user to add resonance to the sound. This creates a high
            pitched sound in combination with the "Filter". The "EG Int" knob works in combination with the "LFO", later to be described.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The "2-pole/4-pole" lever is used to select the type of filter. The Minilogue has two types of filters, consisting of four and two poles respectively. By
            switching the lever to 4 or 2, a type of filter is selected. This determines how coarse the filter is, creating a smooth or rough sound. The "Key track" lever is 
            used to graduately open the filter as the frequenties increase. Via this option the user can create deeper bases and clearer trebbled sounds.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The "Velocity" knob is used to affect the filter based on how hard the keys are pressed. If the selection is turned on and the user presses the 
                keys in a fast way, the filter wil decrease in effect, therefore letting more sound through, creating a more trebbled sound. This lever has a halfway 
                option as well, using the effect only at 50%.
