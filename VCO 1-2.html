           <p><h1>VCO 1-2</h1>
               The VCO, better known as Voltage Controlled Oscilator, can be used to generate a sound. This sound can exist from three different forms, but only one form at a time.
               The sound can be selected using the "Wave" lever. Using this lever the user will determine which type of sound the VCO will generate. The options are Sawtooth, Triangle and Square wave. Using the 
                octave switch the user can determine in which octave the soundwave must be, therefore giving the sound a higher or lower pitch. This sound can then be finetuned using the pitch and shape wave. 
                Pitch is used to offset the soundwave, shape is used to modulate the sound, giving it a different, extra shape and more depth.</p>
                <br>
                <p><h1>VCO 2 Modulation</h1>    
                The VCO 2 Modulation section gives the user more room to experiment with the generated soundwaves. With the knobs and levers "Cross mod depth", "Pitch EG int", "Sync" and "Ring".
                The "Cross Mod Depth" is used to shift the waves from the VCO's, this gives a chorus effect to the sound, therefore giving more depth. The "Pitch EG int" knob is used to modulate the start
                of the sound, starting from a lower pitch moving to a higher pitch or starting on a higher pitch moving to a lower pitch. This is simply adding more depth to the sound and gives the user
                space to experiment with the synthesiser. After those two nobs come the two levers. "Sync" is used to synchronise the two waveforms from VCO 1 and 2, just as simple as that. It is used when some
                dissonants or flaws are needed to be removed from the sound, the two waves can be lined up using this lever. The last option, "Ring" is used to give a bell like effect to the sound.
